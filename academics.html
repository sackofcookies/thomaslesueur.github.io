            <h3>Blue, Red, and White</h3>
            <p>
                The Game of Magic: The Gathering is split up into 5 colors. Each of these colors represents certain mechanics in the game, but they also correspond to ideals. White stands for order, law, and peace. Blue represents logic, curiosity, and intelligence, Black means power, selfishness, and ambition. Red is for emotion, freedom, and impulse. Green represents tradition and nature. Each of these colors take on a new meaning when combined. The combination that I feel fits me the most is blue, red, and white.<br /><br />
                Blue values knowledge. Even from a young age I have always enjoyed learning new things. I like to ask questions about everything. In the actual game blue cards are covered in references to knowledge and learning. When you play blue, you tend to play more carefully. You cast spells to draw cards and get just the information that you need. Spells that draw cards are often called things that invoke learning or being prepared like Brainstorm and Opt. I like to live my life like this: learning new things to prepare for the future. Lately I've been learning a lot about computer science in the hopes of getting a job in computer science while I continue my education.<br /><br />
                Red values emotion. I mostly show this through humor. I love making jokes. I think humor is important to happiness. Red also values freedom. Freedom is something that is very important to me. I enjoy being able to express myself. The actual game's cards aren't the greatest representation of what the philosophy of red really is. Cards that are just red usually show fits of anger and fire. Showing that emotion on its own is not really the greatest. However, red really shines when it is mixed with other colors.<br /><br />
                White values order. I've always been someone who follows rules. I've always hated it when other people blatantly disregard rules. Another manifestation of White in my life is religion. I have always been religious. It is an important part of my life. It helps give order and hope to my life. White cards in the game are often fair. Instead effects that just help you, they help everyone or give your opponent something in return for the effect. I try to be fair with what I do.<br /><br />
                The different combinations of the colors Blue, Red, and White have their own meanings. Blue and Red often is emotion with logic such as art, creativity, and invention. I have always enjoyed making things. Many types of art I have tried I have not been great at, but I still like trying. An art style I enjoy a lot is programming. Computers have always interested me and Blue Red fits that. Red and White often represents the desire to protect. I would hate it if the people I loved were hurt. Making sure they stay safe is important to me. For example is that my brother has autism. Whenever I hear someone making fun of autism it makes me angry. I will often try to get them to stop. Of all the combinations, I feel Blue and White fit me the least. Blue and White represents strict law. While I like my life to have order, too much order feels smothering. Blue and White also tend to follow laws exactly rather than following the spirit of law. I feel these colors really express who I am.
